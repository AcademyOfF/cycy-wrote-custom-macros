# Cycy wrote custom macros
### For SugarCube 2 (and beyond, hopefully)

A few macros that were living in GitHub Gists till now. Decided on moving them to a repo. Makes my life easier, yanno?

## Installation

Download this repository (easiest way to grab everything, really) and cherry pick whatever you want in your project. Some might have CSS files, others won't, but everything you need is there. Along with a `README.md` for each macro which has further instructions on installation and usage.

## Macro sets

> ***NOTE:***  
> If you've used previous versions of the macros from GitHub Gists, I'd recommend going through the README files again. There are some changes incompatible with those earlier versions.

1. [Click to Proceed (CTP)](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/cycy-wrote-custom-macros/blob/master/click-to-proceed)  
    - Clean way to reveal text block-by-block in the same passage without having to nest a million `<<linkreplace>>` macros.  
    - Primarily made for VN like interfaces.  


2. [Live-Update](https://github.com/cyrusfirheir/cycy-wrote-custom-macros/blob/master/live-update)  
    - Make the *display* of an expression 'live' and 'update' every such display to see the changes instantly.
    - Under the hood, it works similarly to how the `<<replace>>` and other DOM macros do, but on the surface, it's *wayyy* simpler to use.

That about it... Will add more when it's required.
